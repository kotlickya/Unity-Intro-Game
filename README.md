# Unity Intro Game
Intro-Project
=============
	Hey Guys,
		I created this project to get the ball rolling. Obviously this isnt our project since we didnt vote for it.
		This is just to get us started using git and working together.
		Feel free to add items to the todo list.
		When you are working on an item from the list tell the group to make sure noone else is doing the same one.
		Also feel free to add whatever asssets you want but keep in mind the more imported assets the bigger the file is so try to import things you will use.
	Lets Kick some butt!
